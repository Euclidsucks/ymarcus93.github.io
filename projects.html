<p>Below are some projects I have created.</p>

<h2>Main Projects</h2>

<h3>Bitcoin Profit Calculator</h3>

<p>This is a side project I created a year ago when I was first learning Java. The project is supposed to help the user calculate their profits using Bitcoin. The program stores the amount of Bitcoin the user purchased, how much the user paid for it, and when the user paid for it in a database. Then, the program retrives the latest Bitcoin price and calculates your profits.</p>

<p>You can see the source code <a href="https://github.com/ymarcus93/Bitcoin-Profit-Calc">here</a> on GitHub.</p>

<h3>Sephardi Jews iPhone App</h3>

<p>This was an app I created 3 years ago when I was first learning Objective-C and iOS development. It is an app that connects to an old website I created that discusses the customs of Sephardic Jews. The app connects to the RSS feed of the website and pulls it down for the user. In additon, the app includes other interactive features and useful resources for those who want to learn more about Sephardi Jews.</p>

<p>You can download the app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sephardi-jews/id558301356?mt=8">here</a>.</p>
